PCB to mount and drive a IN9 nixie bargraph tube.

Made with CadSoft Eagle

###Remarks

It does work quite well, although a very short lifetime of the tubes has defeated the plan I had for their usage. I cannot tell if that has anything to do with my circuit or rather my "new old stock" has actually been a "returned old stock"
